This project was realized with a collaborator and friend, Exauce Muanda Suami (Github : https://github.com/exauMS ).
For this project, we were asked to create a cross-platform application thanks to the NET MAUI technology provided by Microsoft.
We opted for the creation of a supermarket product management application. 
This one will manage the creation, deletion, etc. of the products we offer. Our project to as a principle to offer a simple and intuitive interface so that anyone can use it without difficulty.
